# Idea:
The idea revolves around developing a comprehensive health system with a web-based platform as its backbone. This platform will predominantly focus on assisting with skin diseases and promoting overall health and well-being. The key highlights of our idea include:

- Utilization of advanced AI techniques, including deep learning and generative AI.
- Integration of predictive analysis models for skin diseases.
- Provision of tailored nutritional support through a GenAI Dietician.
- Symptom input module for disease prediction.

# Approach
Our approach encompasses the following key components:

- Integration of advanced deep learning models for predictive analysis of skin diseases.
- Utilization of GenAI system for generating detailed reports based on predicted conditions.
- Implementation of a dedicated GenAI Dietician for personalized nutritional support.
- Inclusion of a symptom input module for disease prediction.
- Use GAN in Hair Disease Test
- Use VGG and ResNet in Skin Disease Test
- To Use GAN to analyze Medical Reports

# Innovation
